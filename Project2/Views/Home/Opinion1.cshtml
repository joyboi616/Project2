        I can say that I am a long time admirer of the Spider-Man character, and like many, I got to know this character through the trilogy directed by Sam Raimi, and starring Tobey Maguire. And after that, my fanaticism for it grew after seeing the reboot commanded by Marc Webb and Andrew Garfield, which motivated me to take a look at comics, and video games.

    Because of this, I have been keeping an eye on the character since he lost his body to Dr. Octopus in the comics, until today. I do not say this to make it seem that I am a connoisseur of the character, or that few are equal to me. I say this, to show that I know a bit of the great and endless lore of the character.

        And speaking of the multiversal elephant in the room, the hype for this movie has not been seen in terms of Spider-Man products, which is great because it shows that despite certain aspects, people are interested in the character.

        However, I think that the root of the total collective madness of not only fans of the character, but of the general audience, has been the rumors, the leaks and how they have been handled by the professional media, and youtubers.

        Because despite the fact that since Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) was announced the rumors of the return of Tobey Maguire have always circulated the network, it has never gone viral as much as it is lived today. And it is that due to various factors, such as nostalgia, fans, the pandemic and the state of the film industry, money, and the possibility of crossing universes and knowing variants of the characters of the main line of the MCU make that today This is more likely to occur.

        However, it is worrying how some people act on the internet, whether it is fighting with people whether they believe that more than one Spider-Man will appear in No Way Home, or not. Or go straight to the blows for a ticket for this movie, which at the end of the day, is still a product that has higher claims than to make money in a difficult time for the industry in the most spectacular way possible.
