1. In README.md, describe roles authentication and authorization related to the theme/website. I.E., which controllers did you decide to force authentication & authorization and why

1. I decided that the authentication will be exercised when the user creates an account and logs in so that he can access the Super Roles, but because I could not assign roles, I could not complete my idea of giving certain benefits to certain users with Super Roles.

2. Here's the view of all the tables which connection with each other is one to many:

5.1. I made it impossible to access the Super Roles section for people who do not have an account on the page, since this is supposed to belong to not only the ASP Roles but also to those important members that make the site a somewhat less cold site.

5.2. Similarly, I made it more difficult to access the details of the Movies page, and edit the Users data. However, since I was unable to assign roles, these links will be permanently hidden.
